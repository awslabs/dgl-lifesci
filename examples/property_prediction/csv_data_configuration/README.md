# Molecular Property Prediction on a New CSV Dataset

The scripts in this directory are helpful for quickly prototyping a GNN-based model for molecular property 
prediction on a new CSV dataset.

## Data Preparation

For training, we assume that the molecular properties are recorded in a CSV file, where one column holds the SMILES strings 
of molecules and some other column(s) hold one or multiple molecular properties.

For inference, there are two options:
1) A `.csv`/`.csv.gz` file, where one column holds the SMILES strings of molecules
2) A `.txt` file, where each line corresponds to the SMILES string of a molecule

## Data Analysis (Optional)

We can do a quick analysis to molecules in a CSV file with 

```bash
python analysis.py -c X -sc Y
```

where `X` specifies the path to the CSV file and `Y` specifies the header for the SMILES column in the CSV file.

Other optional arguments include:
- **Number of Processes**: `-np processes` [default=1]
    - Specifies the number of processes to use for computing
- **Result Path**: `-p path` [default=analysis_results]
    - Specifies the path to save the analysis results
    
The analysis results will be saved to the following files in the result path above:
- `valid_canonical_smiles.txt`: Canonical SMILES for valid molecules
- `summary.txt`: A file of the analysis summarized, including
    - Number/percentage of valid molecules
    - Average number of atoms/bonds/rings per molecule
    - Number of molecules for a particular atom/bond descriptor value to appear

## Modeling

Currently we use a default setting as follows:
- Construct molecular graphs for each molecule, where nodes are atoms and edges are bonds
- Perform early stopping and save the model that achieves the best validation performance
- (Optional) Automatically perform hyperparameter search using Bayesian optimization

## Regression
