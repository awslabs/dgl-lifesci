# Molecular Property Prediction on a New CSV Dataset

The scripts in this directory are helpful for quickly prototyping a GNN-based model for molecular property 
prediction on a new CSV dataset.

## Data Preparation

We assume that the molecular properties are recorded in a CSV file, where one column holds the SMILES strings 
of molecules and some other column(s) hold one or multiple molecular properties.

## Regression

## Multi-label Binary Classification
