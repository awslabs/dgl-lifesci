    Parameters
    ----------
    in_feats : int
        Number of input node features.
    out_feats : int
        Number of output node features.
    gnn_norm : str
        The message passing normalizer, which can be `'right'`, `'both'` or `'none'`. The
        `'right'` normalizer divides the aggregated messages by each node's in-degree.
        The `'both'` normalizer corresponds to the symmetric adjacency normalization in
        the original GCN paper. The `'none'` normalizer simply sums the messages.
        Default to be 'none'.
    activation : activation function
        Default to be None.
    residual : bool
        Whether to use residual connection, default to be True.
    batchnorm : bool
        Whether to use batch normalization on the output,
        default to be True.
    dropout : float
        The probability for dropout. Default to be 0., i.e. no
        dropout is performed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    in_feats : int
        Number of input node features.
    hidden_feats : list of int
        ``hidden_feats[i]`` gives the size of node representations after the i-th GCN layer.
        ``len(hidden_feats)`` equals the number of GCN layers.  By default, we use
        ``[64, 64]``.
    gnn_norm : list of str
        ``gnn_norm[i]`` gives the message passing normalizer for the i-th GCN layer, which
        can be `'right'`, `'both'` or `'none'`. The `'right'` normalizer divides the aggregated
        messages by each node's in-degree. The `'both'` normalizer corresponds to the symmetric
        adjacency normalization in the original GCN paper. The `'none'` normalizer simply sums
        the messages. ``len(gnn_norm)`` equals the number of GCN layers. By default, we use
        ``['none', 'none']``.
    activation : list of activation functions or None
        If not None, ``activation[i]`` gives the activation function to be used for
        the i-th GCN layer. ``len(activation)`` equals the number of GCN layers.
        By default, ReLU is applied for all GCN layers.
    residual : list of bool
        ``residual[i]`` decides if residual connection is to be used for the i-th GCN layer.
        ``len(residual)`` equals the number of GCN layers. By default, residual connection
        is performed for each GCN layer.
    batchnorm : list of bool
        ``batchnorm[i]`` decides if batch normalization is to be applied on the output of
        the i-th GCN layer. ``len(batchnorm)`` equals the number of GCN layers. By default,
        batch normalization is applied for all GCN layers.
    dropout : list of float
        ``dropout[i]`` decides the dropout probability on the output of the i-th GCN layer.
        ``len(dropout)`` equals the number of GCN layers. By default, no dropout is
        performed for all layers.
