    Parameters
    ----------
    in_feats : int
        Number of input node features.
    hidden_feats : list of int
        ``hidden_feats[i]`` gives the size of node representations after the i-th GCN layer.
        ``len(hidden_feats)`` equals the number of GCN layers.  By default, we use
        ``[64, 64]``.
    activation : list of activation functions or None
        If None, no activation will be applied. If not None, ``activation[i]`` gives the
        activation function to be used for the i-th GCN layer. ``len(activation)`` equals
        the number of GCN layers. By default, ReLU is applied for all GCN layers.
    residual : list of bool
        ``residual[i]`` decides if residual connection is to be used for the i-th GCN layer.
        ``len(residual)`` equals the number of GCN layers. By default, residual connection
        is performed for each GCN layer.
    batchnorm : list of bool
        ``batchnorm[i]`` decides if batch normalization is to be applied on the output of
        the i-th GCN layer. ``len(batchnorm)`` equals the number of GCN layers. By default,
        batch normalization is applied for all GCN layers.
    dropout : list of float
        ``dropout[i]`` decides the dropout probability on the output of the i-th GCN layer.
        ``len(dropout)`` equals the number of GCN layers. By default, no dropout is
        performed for all layers.
