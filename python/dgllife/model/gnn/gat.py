    Parameters
    ----------
    in_feats : int
        Number of input node features
    hidden_feats : list of int
        ``hidden_feats[i]`` gives the output size of an attention head in the i-th GAT layer.
        ``len(hidden_feats)`` equals the number of GAT layers. By default, we use ``[32, 32]``.
    num_heads : list of int
        ``num_heads[i]`` gives the number of attention heads in the i-th GAT layer.
        ``len(num_heads)`` equals the number of GAT layers. By default, we use 4 attention heads
        for each GAT layer.
    feat_drops : list of float
        ``feat_drops[i]`` gives the dropout applied to the input features in the i-th GAT layer.
        ``len(feat_drops)`` equals the number of GAT layers. By default, this will be zero for
        all GAT layers.
    attn_drops : list of float
        ``attn_drops[i]`` gives the dropout applied to attention values of edges in the i-th GAT
        layer. ``len(attn_drops)`` equals the number of GAT layers. By default, this will be zero
        for all GAT layers.
    alphas : list of float
        Hyperparameters in LeakyReLU, which are the slopes for negative values. ``alphas[i]``
        gives the slope for negative value in the i-th GAT layer. ``len(alphas)`` equals the
        number of GAT layers. By default, this will be 0.2 for all GAT layers.
    residuals : list of bool
        ``residual[i]`` decides if residual connection is to be used for the i-th GAT layer.
        ``len(residual)`` equals the number of GAT layers. By default, residual connection
        is performed for each GAT layer.
    agg_modes : list of str
        The way to aggregate multi-head attention results for each GAT layer, which can be either
        'flatten' for concatenating all-head results or 'mean' for averaging all-head results.
        ``agg_modes[i]`` gives the way to aggregate multi-head attention results for the i-th
        GAT layer. ``len(agg_modes)`` equals the number of GAT layers. By default, we flatten
        all-head results for each GAT layer.
    activations : list of activation function or None
        ``activations[i]`` gives the activation function applied to the aggregated multi-head
        results for the i-th GAT layer. ``len(activations)`` equals the number of GAT layers.
        By default, no activation is applied for each GAT layer.
