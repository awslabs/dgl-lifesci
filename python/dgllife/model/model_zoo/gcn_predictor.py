    """GCN-based model for regression and classification on graphs.

    GCN is introduced in `Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks
    <https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907>`__. This model is based on GCN and can be used
    for regression and classification on graphs.

    After updating node representations, we perform a weighted sum with learnable
    weights and max pooling on them and concatenate the output of the two operations,
    which is then fed into an MLP for final prediction.

    For classification tasks, the output will be logits, i.e.
    values before sigmoid or softmax.

    Parameters
    ----------
    in_feats : int
        Number of input node features.
    hidden_feats : list of int
        ``hidden_feats[i]`` gives the size of node representations after the i-th GCN layer.
        ``len(hidden_feats)`` equals the number of GCN layers. By default, we use
        ``[64, 64]``.
    activation : list of activation functions or None
        If None, no activation will be applied. If not None, ``activation[i]`` gives the
        activation function to be used for the i-th GCN layer. ``len(activation)`` equals
        the number of GCN layers. By default, ReLU is applied for all GCN layers.
    residual : list of bool
        ``residual[i]`` decides if residual connection is to be used for the i-th GCN layer.
        ``len(residual)`` equals the number of GCN layers. By default, residual connection
        is performed for each GCN layer.
    batchnorm : list of bool
        ``batchnorm[i]`` decides if batch normalization is to be applied on the output of
        the i-th GCN layer. ``len(batchnorm)`` equals the number of GCN layers. By default,
        batch normalization is applied for all GCN layers.
    dropout : list of float
        ``dropout[i]`` decides the dropout probability on the output of the i-th GCN layer.
        ``len(dropout)`` equals the number of GCN layers. By default, no dropout is
        performed for all layers.
    classifier_hidden_feats : int
        (Deprecated, see ``predictor_hidden_feats``) Size of hidden graph representations
        in the classifier. Default to 128.
    classifier_dropout : float
        (Deprecated, see ``predictor_dropout``) The probability for dropout in the classifier.
        Default to 0.
    n_tasks : int
        Number of tasks, which is also the output size. Default to 1.
    predictor_hidden_feats : int
        Size for hidden representations in the output MLP predictor. Default to 128.
    predictor_dropout : float
        The probability for dropout in the output MLP predictor. Default to 0.
