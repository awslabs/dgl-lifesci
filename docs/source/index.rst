DGL-LifeSci: Bringing Graph Neural Networks to Chemistry and Biology
===========================================================================================

DGL-LifeSci is a python package for applying graph neural networks to various tasks in chemistry
and biology, on top of PyTorch and DGL. It provides:

* Various utilities for data processing, training and evaluation.
* Efficient and flexible model implementations.
* Pre-trained models for use without training from scratch.

We cover various applications in our
`examples <https://github.com/awslabs/dgl-lifesci/tree/master/examples>`_, including:

* `Molecular property prediction <https://github.com/awslabs/dgl-lifesci/tree/master/examples/property_prediction>`_
* `Generative models <https://github.com/awslabs/dgl-lifesci/tree/master/examples/generative_models>`_
* `Protein-ligand binding affinity prediction <https://github.com/awslabs/dgl-lifesci/tree/master/examples/binding_affinity_prediction>`_
* `Reaction prediction <https://github.com/awslabs/dgl-lifesci/tree/master/examples/reaction_prediction>`_
